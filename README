== Notes ==

I've mostly ignored the API specified in the problem.

On problems like "write elementAt", which is basically (well, almost) defined in Haskell, I've tried to avoid using the similar function, because that would be cheating.

I'll care about efficiency from time to time (well, mostly just avoiding using stuff like length, but if it makes the function way uglier, I likely won't care)
